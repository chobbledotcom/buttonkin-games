This is a digital, postcard-sized one-shot for Drama Llamas - a reality TV themed TTRPG about fame hungry llamas. To this play you'll need the rule book, 3-5 players, and a GM, or “Producer” to facilitate the fun.

In Beach Bar-a-Llamas our cutthroat camelid contestants compete to build the hottest beach bar on a newly discovered island in the Medita-llam-ian. The winner gets to keep their business and run it for-real-for-real.

This download contains all the locations, characters, and challenges you need to run a session of Drama Llamas, all on the back of a single digital postcard.
