Welcome! You are the newest worker bee in the hive. You just woke up, your head is as fuzzy as your body, and your siblings are beckoning for you to join them. You follow and they lead you through to the heart of the hive - the dance floor! The world is new and strange, you don’t know your own name yet, but you think you might know a bit about dancing...

In this game you'll learn your hive’s secret dance language, explore your world, make animal friends, and harvest pollen for your hive. This is a sweet, relaxing game to play on a rainy afternoon while journaling and doodling.
